# Themes directory 

This is a simple directory meant for storing theme specific styling settings.

When using the theme-switch script, the respective theme's file will be copied from this directory into the hypr/conf directory as `theme.conf`.

Any themes added to this directory will need to be named after its *master* themes name.
