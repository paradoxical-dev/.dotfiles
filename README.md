A collection of configurations and automation scirpts for Gentoo

# Goals

The main goal is to automate not only the distrobution of configurations and installation of applications/tools but separate them into profiles to be easily distributable across different device types.

This comes from the help of the interactive shell script I call "The Forge". It allows me to not only setup for different devices but also different presets for said devices.

For instance, a desktop can bave different presets for GNOME, KDE, Hyprland, etc. and servers could have a hardened or minimal approach. This allows Gentoo to be even more portable and easily accesible to all of my devices, which is something I value coming from NixOS.
